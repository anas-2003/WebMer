python webmer.py --url "https://target.com" --dump users
```

## üéØ Complete Attack Examples

### WiFi Penetration Testing
```bash
# Complete WiFi security assessment
python webmer.py --wifi-scan

# This will:
# 1. Scan for networks (60 seconds)
# 2. Display all discovered networks
# 3. Allow target selection
# 4. Automatically attack based on security:
#    - Open: Direct connection
#    - WEP: Packet capture and crack
#    - WPA/WPA2: PMKID + handshake + dictionary attack
```

### Network Infrastructure Testing
```bash
# Complete network penetration test
python webmer.py --url "https://target.com" \
                 --network-scan \
                 --scan-type syn \
                 --port-range "1-65535" \
                 --concurrency 100
